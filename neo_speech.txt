What...?
2
What the hell?
3
Who is it?
4
You're two hours late.
5
You got the money?
6
Hold on.
7
If you get caught using that --
8
Right...
9
I don't know... My computer...
10
You ever have the feeling that
you're not sure if you're awake or
still dreaming?
11
I can't.   I have to work tomorrow.
12
Yeah, yeah.   Sure, I'll go.
13
How do you know that name?
14
Who are you?
15
Trinity? The Trinity? The
Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
D-Base?
16
Gee-zus.
17
I just thought... you were a guy.
18
Do you want to go somewhere and
talk?
19
That was you on my computer?
20
How did you do that?
21
Of what?
22
Who is?
23
What is the Matrix?
24
Shitshitshit.
25
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.   Perfectly
clear.
26
Yeah.    That's me.
27
Hello?
28
Morpheus...
29
Who's coming for me?
30
Right now?
31
Holy shit!
32
What the hell do they want with
me?!
33
How?!
34
But what if...?
35
How do you know all this?
36
No!    It's too far away.
37
No way, no way, this is crazy.
38
This is insane! Why is this
happening to me? What did I do?
I'm nobody. I didn't do anything.
39
I'm going to die.
40
This is insane! I can't do this!
Forget it!
41
Shit!
42
Yeah. Wow. That sounds like a
real good deal. But I think I
have a better one. How about I
just give you the finger --
43
And you give me my phone call!
44
You can't scare me with this
Gestapo crap. I know my rights.
I want my phone call!
45
The Agents --
46
What are you talking about? What
the hell is happening to me?
47
... Yes.
48
What the hell is this?!
49
From what?
50
What?   Why?
51
Fine.
52
Why?
53
What is this thing?
54
Jesus Christ! It's real?!
That thing is real?!
55
It's an honor.
56
You could say that.
57
You're Morpheus. You're a legend.
Most hackers would die to meet
you.
58
No.
59
Because I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.
60
The Matrix?
61
What truth?
62
You did all this?
63
What does that mean?
64
Did you...?
65
This can't be...
66
Uh-oh...
67
It's cold.
68
... am I dead?
69
What are you doing?
70
Why do my eyes hurt?
71
Morpheus, what's happened to me?
What is this place?
72
When?
73
Right now, we're inside a computer
program?
74
This -- This isn't real?
75
A.I.? You mean artificial
intelligence?
76
No! I don't believe it!     It's not
possible!
77
Stop!   Let me out!   I want out!
78
Get this thing out of me!
79
Don't touch me! Get away from me!
80
I don't believe it!   I don't
believe it!
81
I can't go back, can I?
82
For what?
83
No.
84
You don't have...
85
Zion?
86
It's a city?
87
Where is it?
88
Jujitsu?    I'm going to learn
jujitsu?
89
No way.
90
Holy shit!
91
Hell yes!
92
This is incredible.   I know kung
fu.
93
You -- You're too fast.
94
I know what you're trying to do --
95
Shit.
96
Okie dokie.     Free my mind.   Right.
No problem.
97
Because... I didn't think I would?
98
I thought it wasn't real.
99
If you are killed in the Matrix,
do you die here?
100
I was...
101
This -- this isn't the Matrix?
102
What are they?
103
Someone?
104
Why?
105
What? Are you trying to tell me
that I can dodge bullets?
106
Squiddy?
107
E.M.P.?
108
Sorry.
109
Is that...?
110
Do you always look at it encoded?
111
... Yeah.
112
Really?
113
How many were there?
114
What happened to them?
115
How?
116
Thanks... for the drink.
117
Of who?
118
See who?
119
God...
120
I used to eat there... Really good
noodles...
121
I have these memories, from my
entire life but... none of them
really happened.
122
What does that mean?
123
But an Oracle can.
124
Obviously.
125
Did you go to her?
126
What did she tell you?
127
What?
128
So is this the same oracle that
made the, uh, prophecy?
129
The beginning?
130
And she knows what?    Everything?
131
And she's never wrong.
132
She helped you?
133
What did she tell you?
134
Morpheus, I don't think this is a
good idea.
135
I told you I don't believe in this
stuff. No matter what she says
I'm not going to believe it, so
what's the point?
136
What do I believe in? Are you
kidding me? What do you think?
The world I grew up in isn't real.
My entire life was a lie. I don't
believe in anything anymore.
137
Why? So I can hear some old lady
tell me, what? That I'm this guy
that everybody's been waiting for?
That I'm supposed to save the
world? It sounds insane.
Unbelievable. And I don't care
who says it, it's still going to
sound insane and unbelievable.
138
And you believe I'm the One?
139
Yeah? What about the other five
guys? The five before me? What
about them?
140
Did you believe in them too?
141
All right.
142
What truth?
143
There is no spoon.
144
Hello?
145
You're the Oracle?
146
Yeah.
147
What vase?
148
Shit, I'm sorry.
149
How did you know...?
150
Who?
151
Honestly?   I don't know.
152
But what?
153
I'm not the One.
154
What?
155
Morpheus. He almost had me
convinced.
156
What do you mean, without him?
157
What?
158
... Right as rain.
159
Whoa.   Deja vu.
160
Nothing.   Just had a little deja
vu.
161
A black cat went past us and then
I saw another that looked just
like it.
162
It might have been.    I'm not sure.
163
What is it?
164
No.   No!   Morpheus!      Don't!
165
We can't leave him!
166
Is Morpheus alive?
167
I don't know.     It just went dead.
168
Go.    You first this time.
169
What are they doing to him?
170
How much time?
171
What do they want?
172
There has to be something that we
can do.
173
Stop!
174
Goddamnit! I don't believe this
is happening!
175
Does it? I don't know. This
can't be just coincidence. It
can't be! Can it?
176
The Oracle. She told me this
would happen. She told me...
177
That I would have to make a
choice...
178
I'm going in.
179
I have to.
180
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed that I'm something I'm
not.
181
I'm not the One, Trinity. The
Oracle hit me with that, too.
182
I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just
another guy. Morpheus is the one
that matters.
183
Why?
184
I know that's what it looks like,
but it's not. I can't logically
explain to you why it's not.
Morpheus believed something and he
was ready to give his life for
what he believed. I understand
that now. That's why I have to
go.
185
Because I believe in something.
186
I believe I can bring him back.
187
What are you doing?
188
No you're not.
189
Guns.   Lots of guns.
190
Yeah?
191
That's why it's going to work.
192
There is no spoon.
193
Trinity!
194
... Help.
195
Do what?
196
It wasn't fast enough.
197
I'm fine. Come on, we have to
keep moving.
198
Can you fly that thing?
199
Get up, Morpheus! Get up!
200
He won't make it.
201
Gotcha!
202
Uh-oh --
203
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
204
Let's go!   You first, Morpheus.
205
Promise me you'll tell me the
rest?
206
No!
207
So are you.
208
My name is Neo.
209
Mr. Wizard, get me the hell out of
here!
210
Hurry, Tank!   I got some serious
pursuit!
211
I'm trying, Trinity.   I'm trying.
212
Uh, help!   Need a little help!
213
It's locked.
214
No!
215
Hi. It's me. I know you're out
there. I can feel you now.
216
I imagine you can also feel me.
217
You won't have to search for me
anymore. I'm done running. Done
hiding. Whether I'm done
fighting, I suppose, is up to you.
218
I believe deep down, we both want
this world to change. I believe
that the Matrix can remain our
cage or it can become our
chrysalis, that's what you helped
me to understand. That to be
free, you cannot change your cage.
You have to change yourself.
219
When I used to look out at this
world, all I could see was its
edges, its boundaries, its rules
and controls, its leaders and
laws. But now, I see another
world. A different world where
all things are possible. A world
of hope. Of peace.
220
I can't tell you how to get there,
but I know if you can free your
mind, you'll find the way.
